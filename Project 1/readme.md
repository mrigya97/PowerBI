RSVP Movies Global Release - Data Analysis
Project Overview
RSVP Movies, an Indian film production company known for its super-hit movies, has historically catered to the Indian audience. However, in 2025, the company is planning to expand its reach by releasing a movie for a global audience. In this project, the company has approached us to analyze the movie data from the past three years to make informed decisions for their global project. The goal is to provide valuable insights using Power BI and DAX, helping RSVP Movies to strategize effectively for their upcoming release.

By leveraging this data, RSVP Movies can understand global trends, audience preferences, and potential areas for growth.

The case study involves various Power BI visualizations, which are aimed at uncovering the most relevant insights from the dataset. This project uses DAX functions, Power Query transformations, and visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.
